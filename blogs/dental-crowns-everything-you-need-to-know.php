                              <p>A dental crown is a tooth-shaped cap that is placed over a damaged or decayed tooth to
                                  restore its shape, size, and strength. It is typically made from materials like
                                  porcelain, ceramic, or metal alloys, and it's custom-made to fit your tooth precisely.

                              <p>A dental crown is needed when a tooth is severely damaged or decayed and cannot be
                                  restored with a filling. A crown can also be used to protect a tooth after a root
                                  canal or to cover a dental implant.</p>

                                      used for front teeth because they can be matched to the color of your natural

                                      back teeth because they're durable and can withstand chewing and grinding.</li>

                              <p>Dental crowns are a common and effective treatment option for restoring damaged or
                                  decayed teeth. With proper care and maintenance, a dental crown can last for many
                                  years and help protect your oral health. If you think you may need a dental crown,
                                  talk to your dentist to learn more about your options and what to expect during the
                                  procedure.</p>
