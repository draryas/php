<li><strong>Improved Aesthetics:</strong> Metal braces are designed to gradually shift your teeth into their proper positions, correcting misalignments and closing gaps. As your teeth become straighter and more aligned, your smile will become more aesthetically pleasing. This positive change in your appearance can greatly enhance your self-confidence and make you proud to show off your smile.</li>
