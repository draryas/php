                              <p>Jaw corrective surgery, also known as orthognathic surgery, is a transformative
                                  procedure that addresses functional issues and enhances the aesthetics of the jaw.
                                  This comprehensive treatment is designed to improve bite alignment, facial harmony,
                                  and overall oral health. In this article, we will explore the key aspects of jaw
                                  corrective surgery to provide patients with a deeper understanding of the procedure.

                              <p>Before proceeding with jaw corrective surgery, a thorough evaluation is conducted by an
                                  oral and maxillofacial surgeon. This assessment includes comprehensive dental and
                                  facial analysis, X-rays, and three-dimensional imaging to determine the extent of the
                                  functional and aesthetic concerns.</p>

                              <p>Jaw misalignment can lead to a range of functional issues such as difficulty in
                                  chewing, speaking, or breathing, as well as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.
                                  By repositioning the jaws, orthognathic surgery can alleviate these problems, improve
                                  jaw functionality, and enhance overall oral health.</p>

                              <p>In addition to functional benefits, jaw corrective surgery can significantly enhance
                                  facial aesthetics. It can address concerns such as an underbite, overbite, or facial
                                  asymmetry, resulting in improved facial proportions, balance, and a more pleasing
                                  appearance.</p>

                              <p>Jaw corrective surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon
                                  makes incisions inside the mouth to access the jawbones and reposition them as needed.
                                  In some cases, additional procedures such as genioplasty (chin surgery) may be
                                  performed simultaneously to achieve optimal facial harmony.</p>

                              <p>Following jaw corrective surgery, a period of healing and adjustment is necessary.
                                  Patients may experience some swelling and discomfort initially, which can be managed
                                  with prescribed medications. A soft or liquid diet is recommended during the initial
                                  healing phase, and regular follow-up appointments with the surgical team are scheduled
                                  to monitor progress.</p>
