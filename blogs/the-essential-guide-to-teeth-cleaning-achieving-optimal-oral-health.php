                              <p>Teeth cleaning is more than just a cosmetic procedure; it's a crucial aspect of
                                  preventive dental care. Neglecting regular cleaning can lead to the accumulation of
                                  plaque and tartar, which are breeding grounds for harmful bacteria. These bacteria can
                                  cause gum disease, cavities, bad breath, and even impact systemic health.</p>

                                  <li><strong>Prevention of Gum Disease:</strong>&nbsp;Dental cleanings remove plaque
                                      and tartar buildup, reducing the risk of gum disease. Gum disease, if left
                                      untreated, can lead to serious oral health issues and may even contribute to heart
                                      disease.</li>

                                      by removing the bacteria responsible for tooth decay. This is especially important
                                      in areas that are difficult to clean through regular brushing.</li>
