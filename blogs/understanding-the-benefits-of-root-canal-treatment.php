                              <p>Root canal treatment, also known as endodontic therapy, is a dental procedure that aims
                                  to save a severely infected or decayed tooth. The process involves removing the
                                  inflamed or infected pulp (the soft center of the tooth), cleaning and disinfecting
                                  the inside of the tooth, and finally filling and sealing the tooth to protect it.</p>

                                  <li><strong>Preservation of Natural Teeth:</strong> Root canal treatment allows you to
                                      keep your natural tooth, maintaining your natural bite and smile. It saves a tooth
                                      that might otherwise need extraction.</li>

                                  <li><strong>Relief from Pain:</strong> Contrary to common belief, a root canal
                                      procedure is designed to eliminate pain, not cause it. With modern anesthetics and
                                      technology, the process is as comfortable as getting a filling.</li>

                                  <li><strong>Efficient and Cost-effective:</strong> Compared to the alternatives like
                                      tooth extraction and replacement with a bridge or implant, a root canal treatment
                                      is generally more cost-effective and requires fewer visits to the clinic.</li>

                                  <li><strong>Prevents Spread of Infection:</strong> By removing the infected pulp, root
                                      canal therapy prevents the spread of infection to the surrounding teeth and gums.
                                  </li>

                                  <li><strong>Enhances Oral Health and Overall Wellbeing:</strong> An untreated tooth
                                      infection can lead to more severe health issues, including abscesses and systemic
                                      infections. A root canal treatment eliminates these risks, contributing to better
                                      overall health.</li>
