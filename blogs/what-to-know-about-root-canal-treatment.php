                              <p>Root canal treatment is a dental procedure that is needed when the soft tissue inside
                                  the tooth, called the pulp, becomes infected or inflamed. This can happen for several
                                  reasons, including:</p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                  <!-- wp:list-item -->
                                  <li>Deep decay: When tooth decay is left untreated, it can spread deep into the tooth
                                      and reach the pulp, causing infection and inflammation.</li>

                                  <li>Tooth damage: Trauma or injury to a tooth can cause the pulp to become inflamed or
                                      infected.</li>

                                  <li>Gum disease: Advanced gum disease can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth,
                                      creating pockets where bacteria can build up and infect the pulp.</li>

                                  <li>Large fillings: Large or repeated fillings can weaken the tooth and damage the
                                      pulp, leading to infection and inflammation.</li>

                              <p>If left untreated, an infected or inflamed pulp can cause severe pain, abscesses, and
                                  even tooth loss. Root canal treatment involves removing the infected or inflamed pulp,
                                  cleaning the inside of the tooth, and sealing it to prevent further infection. The
                                  procedure is typically done under local anesthesia and is often the best way to save a
                                  damaged or infected tooth.</p>

                              <p>No, an infected tooth cannot heal itself. The infection must be treated by a dentist,
                                  as leaving it untreated can lead to further complications and even tooth loss.
                                  Treatment may involve antibiotics, a root canal, or in severe cases, tooth extraction.

                              <p>Root canal procedure is a dental treatment that is performed to save a severely damaged
                                  or infected tooth. Here are some advantages of having a root canal procedure:</p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                              <!-- wp:list -->
                              <ul>
                                  <!-- wp:list-item -->
                                  <li>Relieves pain: The primary reason for a root canal is to relieve the pain
                                      associated with an infected tooth. During the procedure, the damaged or infected
                                      pulp is removed, and the tooth is cleaned and sealed, which can relieve pain and
                                      discomfort.</li>

                                  <!-- wp:list-item -->
                                  <li>Saves the tooth: A root canal can save a tooth that might otherwise need to be
                                      extracted. Saving the tooth can help maintain the natural appearance of your
                                      smile, and prevent adjacent teeth from shifting out of place.</li>

                                  <!-- wp:list-item -->
                                  <li>Prevents infection: A root canal can prevent the spread of infection to other
                                      parts of the mouth and body. If left untreated, an infected tooth can lead to an
                                      abscess, which can be painful and potentially dangerous.</li>

                                  <li>Improves oral health: A root canal can improve your overall oral health by
                                      removing the infection and preventing further damage to your tooth and surrounding
                                      tissues.</li>

                                  <li>Cost-effective: A root canal is typically less expensive than the cost of having a
                                      tooth extracted and replaced with a dental implant or bridge.</li>

                                  <li>Minimal downtime: Most people can return to their normal activities shortly after
                                      a root canal, making it a convenient and relatively low-impact procedure.</li>

                              </ul>

                              <p>Overall, a root canal procedure can provide many benefits, including pain relief,
                                  improved oral health, and cost-effectiveness. If you think you may need a root canal,
                                  it's important to speak with your dentist or endodontist to determine the best course
                                  of treatment.</p>
